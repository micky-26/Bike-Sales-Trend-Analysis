# Bike-Sales-Trend-Analysis

Worked on an Excel project called "Bike Sales Trend Analysis" and created an interactive dashboard for it. The objective of this project is to analyze the bike sales data across various regions, occupations, age etc.

The following steps were performed in this project:

1) data cleaning to remove any duplicates.
2) created custom columns to extract additional information from the dataset.
3) generated Pivot tables, Charts, and Graphs to summarize the data and present it visually, making it easier to understand.
5) Lastly, I built a dashboard in Excel with slicers, which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.

Key Insights:
1.      A significant number of Middle Age group individuals purchased more bikes compared to Adolescent and Old people.
2.      A considerable percentage of people use bikes for short-distance travel.
3.      North American region had a higher proportion of bike purchases compared to the Pacific and Europe.
4.      Male individuals with a higher average income purchased more bikes compared to females who had a slightly lower average income.
5.      People who have larger families with more than 2 children may not prefer to buy bikes as they may need a larger vehicle to accommodate their family.kee
